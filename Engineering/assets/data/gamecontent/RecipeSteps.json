My method has been to line a fine strainer with four damp layers of cheesecloth and allow the remaining moisture in the yogurt to separate itself, with the help of gravity, into a separate bowl. Food-sterile cheesecloth is available at most grocery stores, and you can also find it in the food section of many craft stores (use those coupons for added savings). This step can take upwards of an hour, so exercise patience. Help speed up the process by mixing the yogurt and pressing it against the cheesecloth with a spatula. The liquid is inclined to rise to the surface."
