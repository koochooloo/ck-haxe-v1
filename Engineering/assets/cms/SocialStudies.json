My name is Aida. I am making injeri for our meal. Have you ever eaten injeri? We eat it with every meal. Injeri is like a long, thin pancake, but it is sour. We spread it out over the table and put food on top of it. We break off pieces of the injeri and use it to scoop up the food we want to eat! My favorite way of eating injeri is to roll it up and dip it into my spicy curry.","QUESTION_VO":"Ethiopia01Favorite.ogg","QUESTION":"What is Aida's favorite way to eat injeri?","WEEK":"10","WA_1_VO":"ScoopOfCurry.ogg","WA_1_TEXT":"With a scoop of curry","CA_IMAGE":"","INCLUDE":"Y","ID":"117","WA_2_IMAGE":"","QUESTION_IMAGE":"GirlInjeriEthiopia","GRADE":"K","QUESTION_TYPE":"Adaptive (Harder)","COUNTRY_FACT_VO":"EthiopiaFact01.ogg"}]
